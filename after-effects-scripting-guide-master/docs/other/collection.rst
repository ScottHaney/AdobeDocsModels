.. _Collection:

Collection object
################################################

Like an array, a collection associates a set of objects or values as a logical group and provides access to them by index. However, most collection objects are read-only. You do not assign objects to them yourselfâ€”their contents update automatically as objects are created or deleted.

.. note::
   The index numbering of a collection starts with 1, not 0.
