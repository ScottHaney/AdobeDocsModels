The After Effects Object Model
------------------------------

As you look through this reference section, which is organized alphabetically by object, you can refer to the following diagrams for an overview of where the various objects fall within the hierarchy, and their correspondence to the user interface.

Hierarchy diagram of the main After Effects scripting objects

Note that the `File <https://extendscript.docsforadobe.dev/file-system-access/file-object.html>`_, Folder, and Socket objects are defined by ExtendScript, and are documented in the `JavaScript Tools Guide <https://extendscript.docsforadobe.dev/>`_. ExtendScript also defines the ScriptUI module, a set of window and user-interface control objects, which are available to After Effects scripts. These are also documented in the `JavaScript Tools Guide <https://extendscript.docsforadobe.dev/>`_. The hierarchy of objects in scripting corresponds to the hierarchy in the user interface.

The application contains a Project panel, which displays a project. The project contains compositions, which contain layers. The source for a layer can be a footage file, placeholder, or solid, also listed in the Project panel. Each layer contains settings known as properties, and these can contain markers and keyframes. The renderqueue contains render-queue items as well as render settings and output modules. All of these entities are represented by objects in scripting.

.. note::
   To avoid ambiguity, this manual uses the term "attribute" to refer to JavaScript object properties, and the term "property" or "AE property" to refer to After Effects layer properties.

**Object summary**

The following table lists all objects alphabetically, with links to the documentation page for each.
